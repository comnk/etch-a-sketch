This project is a basic personal project that I created to strengthen my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

**Features**

- Can create a new grid of any size
- Works like how an etch-a-sketch toy works (hover over squares to fill them in and create a design)
- Can reset grid to erase the board and make a new drawing
